            to excite and delight our customers.
            Our vision for the future is to create
            experiential dining that is more than just
            a night out. We aim to bring quality and
            luxury across all aspects of our brand.
            The approach of TOWN is to develop our
            brand with the understanding of both our
            culture and consumer insights. Within our
            vision always lives the promise of inspiring creativity, conversation and quality.
            Our audience is a high-end clientele who
            values a dining experience. The age range
            of our customers are from early 30s-60s.
            We would like them to come back for both personal dining and events.
